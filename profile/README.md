# COVIRAN

Our group is developing an online shop for Coviran which will integrate with a order and delivery platform (also developed by us). The delivery is handled by the orders platform which assigns every delivery to a courier. These couriers also have a specific WebApp for them where they can get new deliveries and interact with the state of it.
